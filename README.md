# Task A â€“ MapReduce Simulation (Cloud Computing Coursework)

This project implements a MapReduce-style parallel data processing system in Python, aimed at determining the passenger(s) with the highest number of flights based on historical airline data.

## Features
- Simulates Map and Reduce stages using multi-threading (ThreadPoolExecutor)
- Outputs two result files:
  - `passenger_flight_counts.csv`
  - `top_passengers.csv`

## Technologies
- Python 3.10+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, csv, concurrent.futures
